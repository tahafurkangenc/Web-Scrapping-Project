Backend of our web project is written in Python Flask. This website takes the entered search value and performs a search on dergipark.com for this value. Then, it analyzes the first 24 articles based on certain parameters and parses the values, then saves them to the MongoDB database we created. We can filter the data in the database through the website based on various combinations according to all its features.
